# 2nd place -[team SomeC](https://zindi.africa/hackathons/south-african-covid-19-vulnerability-map/leaderboard)- solution for the *[African-COVID-19](https://zindi.africa/hackathons/south-african-covid-19-vulnerability-map)* zindi hackathon

## Context
Can we infer important COVID-19 public health risk factors from past data? In many countries census and other survey data may be incomplete or out of date. This challenge is to develop a proof-of-concept for how machine learning can help governments more accurately map COVID-19 risk in 2020 using old data, without requiring a new costly, risky, and time-consuming on-the-ground survey.

The 2011 census gives us valuable information for determining who might be most vulnerable to COVID-19 in South Africa. However, the data is nearly 10 years old, and we expect that some key indicators will have changed in that time. Building an up-to-date map showing where the most vulnerable are located will be a key step in responding to the disease. A mapping effort like this requires bringing together many different inputs and tools. For this competition, weâ€™re starting small. Can we infer important risk factors from more readily available data?

The task is to predict the percentage of households that fall into a particularly vulnerable bracket - large households who must leave their homes to fetch water - using 2011 South African census data. Solving this challenge will show that with machine learning it is possible to use easy-to-measure stats to identify areas most at risk even in years when census data is not collected.

## Evaluation
The error metric for this competition was the Root Mean Squared Error
